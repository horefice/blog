The opening quote of this blog is the best-known placeholder of internet, which will make room for the upcoming posts.

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit..."

For those curious people like me, the lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with some modifications to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.

The original passage begins with: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci velit (translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves, pursues or desires pain itself because it is pain").
